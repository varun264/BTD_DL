# BTD_DL
Manual detection of the brain tumours for cancer diagnosis, from large amount of MRI images generated in a clinical routine, is a difficult task. Here I am trying to make this process robust.

## Libraries and Modules
● Numpy

● Matplotlib.pyplot

● Sklearn

● Tensorflow

● Keras

● Os

● Shutil

## Data Augmentation

BrainMRNet performed well on the dataset.

●Robustness of classification task using the proposed models.

● Results can be improved with data augmentation indicating the need to increase 
the data collection .

● Superiority of artificial intelligence in tumour detection
